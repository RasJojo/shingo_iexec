# Hack4Privacy Feedback (Shingo Team)

Overall, the iExec experience was very good for this project.

## What we appreciated most

- The documentation was clear, well-structured, and detailed enough to build a full end-to-end prototype.
- It was easy to understand the main concepts and move from setup to implementation.
- The provided tooling enabled us to ship a working on-chain + TEE flow in hackathon conditions.

## Main regret

- The only real limitation for us was the RLC faucet cap on testnet (`5 RLC/day`).
- We were running many end-to-end tests, so this quota was quickly exhausted and slowed iteration.

## Final note

Great overall developer experience and strong docs.  
If faucet capacity were higher during hackathons, iteration speed would improve a lot.
